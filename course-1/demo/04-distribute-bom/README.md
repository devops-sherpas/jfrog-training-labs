# Lab: Distribute RBv2

In this lab, we will distribute an RBv2 that we had created in a previous lab.

## Progress

1. From "Artifactory" > "Release Bundles v2", select the Release Bundle you would like to distribute.
   **NOTE**: Currently, you can only distribute RBv2's which are not associated with a JFrog Project.
2. In the panel that lists the bundle's versions, hover to the right, click the three dots, and select "Distribute".
3. Select the distribution targets.
4. Check the "Auto create missing repositories" checkbox.
5. Click "Distribute".

You will be sent back to the "Actions" panel, where you will see the distribution action.
Hover over the action's row to the right, and click "View Details" to show the distribution's progress.
