# Lab: Switch to JFrog Projects

In this lab, we will implement the switch to JFrog projects.

Our starting point will be an Artifactory environment with no projects at all.

## Initialization

First, we will need to initialize our Artifactory environment to our starting point: a "flat" Artifactory
environment, with no projects.
